# Design
- Game should feel like a rougelike pacman
- Game needs to be all about the loot! Fits in with the idea of a
  "disease/curse" of greed: "The Wanting"

# Current
- [x] Second level sword
- [x] Coin and treasure pickups (game has to be about the loot)
- [ ] Treasure chest: spawns treasure
- [ ] Add a little random horizontal movement on a drop of pickup item
- [ ] Pickup items should push away from themselves (no physics though -- maybe).
- [ ] Monster loot drop
- [ ] Dont spawn pickups on top of each other or on doors
- [ ] Music and sound effects
- [ ] Smart respawn so player doesn't die when respawning
- [ ] bug: stats not reset on death and on drop maybe
- [ ] bug: does not drop items on death
- [ ] bug: itch deployment is so dark
- [ ] first level mouse blends in with background

# Next Goal
- [ ] Work on the game play (make it a game)
    - todo: decide on weapon destruction
    - todo: scoring and exiting the level
    - todo: decide in battle if winner take all or damage even in victory
- [ ] Result Screen and Tally
- [ ] Main menu
- [ ] Add the cage for entrance and exits
- [ ] Start the game "slower".
- [ ] UI: Make "ghosts" "blue" when they can be defeated.
- [ ] UI: Incorporate the "Stats" into the Main Game instead of the way you have
  them on the corners. Simplify this.
- [ ] bug: annoying item rotation on drop and pickup

# Future
- Better spawn system
- Character selection and loadout (vampire surviror-ish)
- PE: Show where a hurt happens
- PE: Doors open and shut
- PE: Monster Death
- Some sort of XP level per character
- Ranged weapons
- Sewer biome
- Dark biome
- Bandit biome
- Demon biome
- Falling obstacles
- Traps
- Encrypted releases
- Social sharing
- bug: Player zooms from one level to the other (rare). The tween animation to
  exit the door starts before the player is in the y-position of the next level
  somehow.
